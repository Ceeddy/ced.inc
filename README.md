# My Creative Portfolio — Static design

This is a **from-scratch static portfolio** that recreates the *layout and interactions* of what i had in mind

## What's inside
- **index.html** — semantic, accessible markup
- **styles.css** — modern, responsive design (CSS Grid/Flexbox, tokens, dark UI)
- **scripts.js** — smooth scroll, scroll‑spy, reveal animations, modal, basic form handling
- **assets/img/** — placeholder SVGs (safe to use)

## Quick start
1. Download the ZIP.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
3. Replace text and images with your content.

## Notes
- Buttons like **Book a Call** are wired to work; swap in your Calendly/Meet/Zoom links.
- The contact form is client‑only for now.
