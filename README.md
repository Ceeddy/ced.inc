# Creative Portfolio — Static Template

This is a **from-scratch static portfolio** that recreates the *layout and interactions* of the referenced page you shared, without copying its proprietary text or images. Replace the placeholder copy and SVGs with your own content.

## What's inside
- **index.html** — semantic, accessible markup
- **styles.css** — modern, responsive design (CSS Grid/Flexbox, tokens, dark UI)
- **scripts.js** — smooth scroll, scroll‑spy, reveal animations, modal, basic form handling
- **assets/img/** — placeholder SVGs (safe to use)
- **No build step required** — just open `index.html`

## Quick start
1. Download the ZIP.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
3. Replace text and images with your content.

## Notes
- Buttons like **Book a Call** are wired as demos; swap in your Calendly/Meet/Zoom links.
- The contact form is client‑only for now. Hook to a service (Netlify Forms, Formspree) or your own backend to collect submissions.
